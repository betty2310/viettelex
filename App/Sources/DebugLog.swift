// DebugLog.swift
// Opt-in, in-memory ring buffer for field-diagnosing the terminal tap — above all
// the keyboard-hang class (synthetic-event cascade / tap wedge). OFF by default
// (AppState.debugLogging); while off, log() is a cheap early return, so call sites
// are safe to leave on the hot path. While on it keeps the last N timestamped lines
// in memory only (no file I/O) that the user copies from Settings → Thử Nghiệm and
// pastes to the developer.
//
// PRIVACY: records ONLY lifecycle / health events (tap create/teardown, breaker
// trips, active-state, emit bursts as COUNTS) — never the characters typed. Keep it
// that way: this buffer is meant to be shared.
